# CG_pH


#This project aims to assess the short-term physiological response of two populations of the marine mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis, to pH stress.
#Each population experiences unique regimes of pH variability, which theory predicts may lead to the evolution of distinct patterns of plasticity among individuals within each population.
#Using gene expression as the trait of interest, I am testing whether the population from the variable environment displays greater inter-individuals variation, yet less gene expression plasticity, than the population from the stable pH environment.

#This repository contains all data and code used in the experiment.
